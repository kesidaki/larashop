-- Scopes are constraints for a Model. They will automatically add certain limitations to the query results. After declaring a scope like this:

public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model) {
	$builder->has('hasSomething');
}

-- Go to model and include the scope like:

protected static function boot() {
	parent::boot();

	static::addGlobalScope(new NameScope);
}
