-- Middlewares defines actions that will automatically take place when sending and/or receiving a http request

-- After creating a middleware we declare it in the kernel.php file

-- Go to protected $routeMiddleware
		Add to the array:
			'middlewareName' => middlewarePath

-- Go to $middlewareGroups and add the middlewareName to the array for web or api (both if you want)
	If you want to pass variables to the middleware do it like this
	'middlewareName:variableValue'
